### Appyx 
Model driven navigation library library that provides a declarative approach to handle navigation in your Android app.
It follows the principles of the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture, separating the navigation logic from the UI components.
The "model"  refers to the destination models that represent the screens or components of your app and are used to define the navigation structure
and handle navigation actions within the library.
